Blogging platform REST API 

Backend solution for the blogging platform was implemented using Typescript. 

For data storage, MongoDB is used. 

To test the application, you will need to download MongoDB Community Server: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.
To see the data inside the database, you can install MongoDB Compass. It is offered when installing MongoDB Community Server.

If you have MongoDB Compass installed, you can connect to the local database to check the data inside it at any given moment.

To access the API, Swagger is used and is available at http://localhost:5000/api-docs.
